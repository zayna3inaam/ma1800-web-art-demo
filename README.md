Web Art Project README


This web-art project explores the experiences and dangers of growing up online. With platforms that have historically glamorised unhealthy ideals and in particular, affect the younger generation who have grown up entirely within the world of social media. This web-artwork reflects how digital spaces shape identity, self image, mental health and aims to evoke the emotional and physical landscape of these digital environments. 

Influential case studies- 
•Like pearls- https://likepearls.com/
This project was particularly influential for its overwhelming femininity,passive aggressive phases and the faceless female models that create both discomfort but also curiosity. The tension between softness and unease directly informed the aesthetic and tone for pages 1 and 2 of my website.  

Challenges Encountered-
As someone with no prior coding experience I found this entire project quite challenging, but beyond the technical learning curve, I found translating emotional and psychological themes into my code quite difficult and balancing aesthetic whilst maintaining basic coherence was also a big challenge as my plan wasn't as detailed as I’d hoped, which is something to reflect on and implement for next time.

Future extensions-
With more time and resources I’d have done a more sufficient plan by conducting deeper research into digital culture. I'd also like to implement more advanced interaction, including visual distortions and scroll based transitions. 

Assets created-
The mp3 player on index.html, (first page), The video is of one of my friends from back home, capturing the unreplicable warmth of girlhood. The clip is fun and playful, yet as it keeps repeating starts to feel slightly uncanny. I used my ipad and apple pencil to cut out the screen of the mp3 image, and then used it as an overlay for my video. I thought it would be interesting to include different pieces of technological history. The rest of the images were not taken by me, although have been edited; such as backgrounds being moved, images distorted, or used as a background.
Creative and technical reflection-
This project allowed me to engage with the internet as a creative medium rather than a functioning platform. I explored how layout, repetition and interaction can communicate emotional and cultural ideas. This project has helped me to understand the expressive and artistic potential of code. The final work represents both my personal experience with growing up online and broader cultural pressures of digital life.
